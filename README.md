# seer-py
Python SDK for the Seer data platform, which handles authenticating a user, downloading channel data, and uploading labels/annotations.

## Install
To install, simply clone or download this repository, then type `pip install .` which will install all the dependencies.

### Epilepsy Ecosystem Data
For users attempting to download data for the [Epilepsy Ecosystem](https://www.epilepsyecosystem.org/howitworks/), please download the [latest release](https://github.com/seermedical/seer-py/releases/latest) instead of cloning the repository or downloading the master branch. Then use the script `ContestDataDownloader.py` in `Examples` as it will guide you through the download process.

## Requirements
This library currently requires Python 3, and it if you don't currently have a Python 3 installation, we recommend you use the Anaconda distribution for its simplicity, support, stability and extensibility. It can be downloaded here: https://www.anaconda.com/download

The install instructions above will install all the required dependencies, however, if you wish to install them yourself, here's what you'll need:
- [`gql`](https://github.com/graphql-python/gql): a GraphQL python library is required to query the Seer platform. To install, simply run: `pip install gql`
- Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib are also required. Some of these installs can be tricky, so Anaconda is recommended, however, they can be installed separately. Please see these guides for more detailed information:
  - https://scipy.org/install.html
  - https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
  - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

To run the Jupyter notebook example (optional, included in Anaconda): `pip install notebook`

## Getting Started

Check out the [Example](`Examples/Example.ipynb`) for a step-by-step example of how to use the SDK to access data on the Seer platform. 

To start a Jupyter notebook, run `jupyter notebook` in a command/bash window. Further instructions on Jupyter can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook
